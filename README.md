## Build

To build the app, first [install Unity 2021.3.25f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.25). You will need a Unity account, a pro one is not necessary as long as you are building a test app.

To build through command lines:

`[Unity Editor Path] -projectPath [Unity project Path] -batchmode -buildTarget [Android or iOS] -executeMethod AutomaticBuild.Perform [Main scene Path] -quit`

Scene path to add to the build:
`Assets/Scenes/Main.unity

When building for Android, you will get an .apk file that can be directly installed on phones (if you want to do it from a computer, look a [this tutorial](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-apps-via-adb-android/).

When building for iOS, you will get an Xcode project that will have to be compiled in Xcode > 12.
